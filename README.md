# QAC SFIA2 Project

This application is a simple Flask application, ready to be deployed, for your SFIA2 project.

The following information should be everything you need to complete the project.

## Brief

The application must:

- Be deployed to a **Virtual Machine for testing**
- Be deployed in a **managed Kubernetes Cluster for production**
- Make use of a **managed Database for both testing and production**

## Application

The application is a Flask application running in **2 micro-services** (*front-end* and *back-end*).  

The database directory is available should you: 
  - want to use a MySQL container for your database at any point, *or*
  - want to make use of the `Create.sql` file to **pre-populate your database**.

The application works by:
1. The front-end service making a GET request to the back-end service. 
2. The back-end service using a database connection to query the database and return a result.
3. The front-end service serving up a simple HTML (`index.html`) to display the result.

### Database Connection

The Database connection is handled in the `./backend/application/__init__.py` file.

A typical Database URI follows the form:

```
mysql+pymysql://[db-user]:[db-password]@[db-host]/[db-name]
```

### Environment Variables

The application makes use of **2 environment variables**:

- `DATABASE_URI`: as described above
- `SECRET_KEY`: any *random string* will work here

### Running a Flask Application

Typically, to run a Flask application, you would:

1. Install the pip dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:

```
python3 app.py
```

## Infrastructure

The **Minimum Viable Product** for this project should adhere to the following infrastructure diagram:

**Stretch goals** for this project include:

- Using **Terraform to configure the Kubernetes Cluster** for production 
- Using **Terraform and Ansible to configure the Test VM**
- Running **Integration Tests**, as well as Unit Tests

Completing the stretch goals should yield an infrastructure diagram similar to the following:
